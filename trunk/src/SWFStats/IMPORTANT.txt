VERY IMPORTANT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before you do anything at all with SWFStats you *must* call the Initialise method in SWFStats.Tracker.  If you do not call begin
by calling SWFStats.Tracker.Initialise first then you will not collect any data.  This is because the "SourceUrl" variable is
null by default, and if that variable is null then SWFStats assumes the player had problems connecting to its servers so it 
doesn't even try to log any data.

So:

1) Paste any relevant data of yours from the 'api code' page in SWFStats into the Config.as file.

2) Add this somewhere nice and early in your game, BEFORE you try and log any views, plays, or anything else.

	SWFStats.Tracker.Initialise(loaderInfo.loaderURL); 






PROBLEMS:

1) Check you put your SWFID and GUID into Config.as.  Those are the two pieces of data that seperate your game data from 
   everyone else's, and if you don't send valid data your requests are simply ignored because we don't know who owns that
   data

2) Check you called SWFSTats.Tracker.Initialise(loaderInfo.loaderURL) BEFORE you called anything else

3) Check the API documentation, sign in to http://my.swfstats.com/, navigate to the API Code page for your game and click API Notes

4) If you're still having problems then try the SWFStats support
